# Phase 1 Master README — NEET Prep AI Platform

This README ties together all Phase 1 documents and explains the order in which to read and execute them.

## Document Set

- **[prd-phase1.md](./prd-phase1.md)** — Product Requirements for Phase 1 (scope, deliverables, success criteria).
- **[planning-phase1.md](./planning-phase1.md)** — Roadmap, milestones, dependencies, risks, timeline.
- **[tasklists-phase1.md](./tasklists-phase1.md)** — Granular GitHub-style task checklists for each milestone.
- **[mermaid-phase1-bmad-extended.md](./mermaid-phase1-bmad-extended.md)** — Extended Mermaid diagrams aligned to BMAD stages (Blueprint → Model → Architect → Develop).

## Recommended Reading & Execution Order

1. **prd-phase1.md**  
   Start with the PRD to understand what Phase 1 covers (scope, features, success criteria).

2. **planning-phase1.md**  
   Next, review the roadmap and milestones to see how the work is staged and the timeline.

3. **tasklists-phase1.md**  
   Translate the roadmap into actionable work. Each section can be copied into GitHub issues.

4. **mermaid-phase1-bmad-extended.md**  
   Finally, use the BMAD diagrams to visualize the Phase 1 flow (problem → solution architecture → action steps).

## Execution Flow

- Use this README as your **entry point**.
- Follow the documents in order to move from concept → plan → tasks → system design.
- As you progress through milestones, update **tasklists-phase1.md** with checkmarks or move items into GitHub issues.
- Keep **mermaid-phase1-bmad-extended.md** open as a visual map.

## Next Steps After Phase 1

- Prepare Phase 2 PRD (Dashboards, Live Classes, Notifications, i18n).
- Extend planning, tasklists, and BMAD diagrams accordingly.
