# Story 1.5: AI Tutor Enhancement & RAG Implementation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** student,  
**I want** an intelligent AI tutor that can answer my questions contextually based on the study materials,  
**so that** I can get personalized explanations and guidance tailored to the specific content I'm studying.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1.5.1**: RAG ingestion pipeline processes and indexes content correctly
2. **AC-1.5.2**: AI tutor provides contextually relevant answers based on indexed content
3. **AC-1.5.3**: Conversation history is properly maintained and accessible
4. **AC-1.5.4**: Response streaming provides smooth real-time interaction
5. **AC-1.5.5**: AI safety and content filtering mechanisms are in place
6. **AC-1.5.6**: Performance optimization ensures reasonable response times

## Priority

High - Core AI functionality

## Estimated Effort

12-18 hours

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup âœ… (Completed)
- Story 1.2: Database Schema & Authentication Setup (Required)
- Story 1.3: Content Management System (Required)
