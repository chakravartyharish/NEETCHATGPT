# Story 1.3: Content Management System

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** educator and student,  
**I want** a comprehensive content management system for courses, lessons, and educational materials,  
**so that** content can be organized, uploaded, accessed, and delivered efficiently with proper permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. **AC-1.3.2**: File upload and storage system works with Supabase Storage
3. **AC-1.3.3**: Signed URL delivery for secure media access
4. **AC-1.3.4**: Content hierarchy (courses → modules → lessons) is implemented
5. **AC-1.3.5**: Content search and filtering capabilities are working
6. **AC-1.3.6**: Content access permissions are enforced

## Priority
