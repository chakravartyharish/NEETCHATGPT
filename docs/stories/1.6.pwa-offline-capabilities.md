# Story 1.6: PWA & Offline Capabilities

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** student in areas with limited connectivity,  
**I want** the platform to work offline and sync data when connection is restored,  
**so that** I can continue studying and taking quizzes even without internet access.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1.6.1**: Service Worker provides app shell caching and offline functionality
2. **AC-1.6.2**: Critical content is cached for offline access
3. **AC-1.6.3**: Quiz attempts work offline and sync when online
4. **AC-1.6.4**: Background sync handles data synchronization automatically
5. **AC-1.6.5**: Offline indicators inform users of connection status
6. **AC-1.6.6**: Progressive loading optimizes performance on slow connections

## Priority

Medium-High - Essential for target user base

## Estimated Effort

8-12 hours

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup âœ… (Completed)
- Story 1.2: Database Schema & Authentication Setup (Required)
- Story 1.3: Content Management System (Recommended)
- Story 1.4: Quiz Engine Implementation (Recommended)
