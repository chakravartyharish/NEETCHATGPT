# Story 1.2: Database Schema & Authentication Setup

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to implement the complete database schema with proper authentication and authorization,  
**so that** users can securely register, login, and access content based on their roles and permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1.2.1**: Supabase database schema is fully implemented with all required tables
2. **AC-1.2.2**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies are configured for tenant isolation
3. **AC-1.2.3**: Supabase Auth is properly configured with email/password and OAuth
4. **AC-1.2.4**: Authentication middleware protects routes appropriately
5. **AC-1.2.5**: User profiles and roles system is functional
6. **AC-1.2.6**: Database migrations and seed data are working

## Priority

High - Foundation requirement for all other features

## Estimated Effort

5-8 hours

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup âœ… (Completed)

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Database Schema Implementation

- [ ] Review and enhance existing migration (0001_init.sql)
- [ ] Verify all tables from ERD are created:
  - [ ] users, profiles, institutions
  - [ ] courses, lessons, modules
  - [ ] questions, quizzes, attempts
  - [ ] documents, embeddings (for RAG)
  - [ ] ai_sessions, ai_messages (for tutor history)
- [ ] Add any missing indexes for performance
- [ ] Configure proper foreign key relationships

### Row Level Security (RLS) Setup

- [ ] Enable RLS on all tables
- [ ] Create tenant isolation policies
- [ ] Create role-based access policies:
  - [ ] Student access policies
  - [ ] Educator access policies
  - [ ] Institution admin policies
- [ ] Test RLS policies with different user roles

### Authentication Enhancement

- [ ] Configure Supabase Auth settings
- [ ] Enhance login page with better UX
- [ ] Add user registration flow
- [ ] Implement OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- [ ] Create user profile management pages
- [ ] Add password reset functionality

### Route Protection

- [ ] Enhance middleware.ts for route protection
- [ ] Create authentication helpers
- [ ] Implement role-based route access
- [ ] Add loading states for auth checks
- [ ] Handle authentication errors gracefully

### Database Operations

- [ ] Create database utility functions
- [ ] Add database seed script with sample data
- [ ] Test migration rollback procedures
- [ ] Document database setup process

## Technical Notes

- Use existing Supabase setup in lib/supabase/
- Leverage existing auth components in app/login/
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Maintain compatibility with existing API routes

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All database tables are created and seeded
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Users can register, login, and manage profiles
- [ ] Protected routes work correctly
- [ ] Authentication state is properly managed
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Code passes all quality checks (lint, typecheck, build)
