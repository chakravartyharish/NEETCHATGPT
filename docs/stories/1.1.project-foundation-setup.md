# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

## Status

Completed ✅

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the core project foundation with proper development environment, dependencies, and initial configuration,
**so that** the team can begin development with a consistent, properly configured codebase that follows our technical standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1.1.1**: Project repository is properly initialized with all necessary configuration files
2. **AC-1.1.2**: All core dependencies are installed and configured according to tech stack requirements
3. **AC-1.1.3**: Development environment is set up with proper linting, formatting, and type checking
4. **AC-1.1.4**: Basic project structure follows the defined source tree architecture
5. **AC-1.1.5**: Initial Next.js application is functional with basic routing and layout structure
6. **AC-1.1.6**: TypeScript configuration is properly set up with strict type checking
7. **AC-1.1.7**: Tailwind CSS is configured and integrated with proper design system foundation
8. **AC-1.1.8**: Development scripts are available for common tasks (dev, build, test, lint)

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Structure

Based on the architecture documents, implement the following key directory structure:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx             # Root layout component
├── page.tsx               # Landing page
├── globals.css            # Global styles with Tailwind
├── (auth)/                # Authentication route group (future)
├── (dashboard)/           # Protected dashboard routes (future)
└── api/                   # API routes (basic health check)

components/
├── ui/                    # Base UI components
├── layout/                # Layout-specific components
└── common/                # Common utility components

lib/
├── utils/                 # General utilities
├── hooks/                 # Custom React hooks
├── stores/                # Zustand stores (future)
└── validations/           # Zod validation schemas (future)
```

### Technology Stack Implementation

- **Next.js 14+**: Use App Router exclusively, no Pages Router
- **TypeScript 5+**: Enable strict mode and all recommended strict rules
- **Tailwind CSS 3+**: Use utility-first approach with custom design tokens
- **Package Manager**: Use pnpm for efficient dependency management
- **Linting**: ESLint with Next.js and TypeScript configurations
- **Formatting**: Prettier with consistent formatting rules

### Configuration Requirements

- **TypeScript**: Enable strict mode, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, exactOptionalPropertyTypes
- **ESLint**: Extend from @next/core-web-vitals and @typescript-eslint/recommended
- **Prettier**: Configure with 2-space indentation, single quotes, trailing commas
- **Tailwind**: Set up with custom color palette, typography scale, and spacing system
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit linting and formatting, pre-push type checking

### Development Standards

- All new files should use TypeScript (.ts/.tsx extensions)
- Components should be functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Use Next.js App Router conventions for routing and layouts
- Follow file naming conventions: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use CSS-in-JS through Tailwind utilities, avoid custom CSS where possible

### Testing

- **Framework**: Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing
- **Test Location**: Co-locate test files with source files using .test.ts/.test.tsx extensions
- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage on utility functions and core components
- **Test Standards**: Write tests for all exported functions and public component interfaces
- **Integration**: Set up testing scripts in package.json for CI/CD pipeline
